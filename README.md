SuperStore Analysis
Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of business performance, aiming to identify key trends, customer behaviors, and growth opportunities. By analyzing datasets related to sales, customers, and product performance, the project delivers actionable insights and strategic recommendations to improve overall business health and profitability.

Project Goals

The main objectives of this analysis were to:

Analyze Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Examine total sales, orders, and profit to assess overall business performance.

Segment the Customer Base: Understand customer behavior, identify high-value and frequent segments, and analyze customer lifetime value (LTV).

Investigate Customer Churn: Determine churn rates and highlight product categories with the highest churn.

Evaluate Product & Regional Performance: Identify top-performing products and regions, and focus on areas with negative profitability.

Data Sources

The analysis used raw data from the Superstore Dataset:

Kaggle: Superstore Dataset

Key Findings & Insights

Frequent Shoppers Donâ€™t Equal High Value: High frequency does not guarantee high sales; targeting low-performing but frequent customers can uncover growth potential.

Technology Product Churn is Highest: Customers buying technology products have the highest churn, indicating potential issues with quality or post-sale support.

Regional Performance Varies: States like California and New York are profitable, but regions such as Texas show negative profitability across all categories, requiring focused improvement efforts.

Strategic Recommendations

Target Low-Profit Regions and Categories: Focus on underperforming regions and product categories with tailored strategies to boost profitability.

Enhance Technology Customer Experience: Improve customer journey for technology products to reduce churn.

Investigate Regional Operations: Conduct deep-dive analyses of unprofitable regions (e.g., Texas) to identify and fix root causes.

Tools & Technologies

Python & SQL: Data cleaning, analysis, and manipulation

Trello: Project management and workflow tracking

Tableau: For building the interactive dashboard

Challenges & Key Learnings

Understanding the data, creating the ERD diagram, and building the dashboard were the main challenges.

Key learning: Exploring and mapping data thoroughly before analysis ensures accurate insights and helps uncover hidden patterns.
